# octi

### Hi Mr.Gerwing,
Here is the Final Assesment, some pre-requisites:
BEFORE RUNNING THE APP MAKE SURE
 - In Windows display settings you have the scale set to 125% (TODO: Dynamic Scaling for the APP)
 - You run the app in fullscreen
 - Don't have too many things open becasuse Flutter isn't too efficient with a debug app.
 - If you run into performance issues, it might be good to build the app just type "flutter build" in the root of the octi directory and it will create an executable 
 - If you run into any problems, email me.

## DETAILS:
sidebar.dart and main.dart are commented (around 50 lines each)
Flowchart is on search_screen.dart
Pseudocode is on featured_banner.dart
    
Thanks and have a great holidays!s
